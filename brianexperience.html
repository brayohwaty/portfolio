        KENYATTA UNIVERSITY
      </h1>
      <div class="work-experience1-content">
        My work experience began at a junior age at Kenyatta University. The year was 2018, a young vabriant 
        engineer. By then, what biomedical engineering entailed had not gotten into my nerves. The Kenyatta university
        laboratories provided a condusive atmosphere for my learning and practical works. I cannot fail to mention
        the lab technicians who ensured smooth transition of knowledge. They kept yelling at the top of their voices not to 
        connect the LEDs straight to power without  passing the current through a resisitor first.
        <br>
        As a biomedical engineering Attache', I accomplished the following-:
        <ol>
          <li>Analysis of resistors, diodes,capacitors and inductors; their applications in electric circuits, importance and maintenance</li>
          <li>Handle projects using optoelectronic devices such as photo resistors, photo diodes, phototransistors; their applications and mentainance</li>
          <li>Smoothing out of DC voltage ripples to obtain a continuous signal from a rectified signal using a bridge rectifier and thyristor applications</li>
          <li>Simulation of the Audio amplified circuit using proteus software, breadboard implimentation and the solidering process</li>
          <li>Trouble-shooting</li>
          <li>Power transmission and motor operation</li>
          <li>Motor starters; Direct on line(DOL), Star Delta, Rotor resistor starter, Stator resistor starter,Auto transformer starter,</li>    
          <li>AC generators and brushless generator operation</li>
          <li>Domestic installation, consumer unit design, one-way switch, two-way switches, intermittent switches,Three phase coonections, single phase connection
            ,socket connection and three phase motor connection design.
          </li> 
          <li>Handling digital instruments and integrated circuits</li>
          <li>Industrial switching </li>
          <li>Programmable Logic Controllers(PLO); Ladder diagramms</li>
          <li>Automation; Embedded Systems programming using Arduino</li>         
        </ol>
