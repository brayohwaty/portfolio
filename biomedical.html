      <p>
        I am a Graduate Engineer and holds a degree in Biomedical Engineering
        from Kenyatta University. As an individual who is interested in continuous professional 
        development, I have dedicated more than 2years of experience familiarizing myself with 
        softwares used in the Electrical industry. This has resulted in professional competency in all 
        operational and technical aspects not only digital system implementation but also in electrical 
        systems installations. Working with the Kenya ministry of health division of the National Public 
        Health Laboratory as a biomedical engineering intern, I demonstrated strong problem-solving skills 
        and the ability to work under high-pressure and challenging environment. My responsibilities varied 
        throughtout the maintaining, installation and testing of highly sophisticated biomedical and electrical
        systems. In addition, I was relied upon to manage my fellow attachees. I am a young professional who upholds 
        integrity . I am able to indentify engineered solutions to recurring electrical issues. I have 
        functional knowledge of all biomedical legistration, codes, and standards of practice, and have gained
         expertise in use of industry specific tools and applications.
        My technical expertise include:-
        <ol>

      <p>
        As a young professional, I have build my programming skills to near perfection. I am capable of managing projects
        and providing results consistently. I am adept at coding, and my diverse knowledge of the programming languages 
        allows me to build unique code specific for arduino prototyping. I would like to learn more languages and 
        am open to work with any organization which will provide a conducive environment to achieve such. i have killer skills
        in the following programming languages.
        <ol>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>C##</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ol> 
      Am also learning Javascript to add to my basket of known programming languages.
